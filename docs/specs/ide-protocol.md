# Pi x IDE Protocol

Pi x IDE connects Pi to an IDE through a local WebSocket discovered by lock files.

## Lock files

Directory: `~/.pi/pi-x-ide/lock`.

Example file: `vscode-12345-48123.lock`

Neovim uses the same protocol version and writes files named `nvim-<pid>-<port>.lock`. JetBrains IDEs use the same protocol version and write files named `jetbrains-<pid>-<port>.lock`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ide": "vscode",
  "name": "Visual Studio Code",
  "transport": "ws",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 48123,
  "authToken": "random-hex-token",
  "workspaceFolders": ["/home/user/project"],
  "pid": 12345,
  "runningInWindows": false,
  "createdAt": "2026-06-09T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-06-09T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Rules:

- Lock directory should be mode `0700`.
- Lock files should be mode `0600`.
- Writers should write a temp file and rename it into place.
- `host` remains required for compatibility, but Pi may resolve a different connection host before opening the WebSocket.
- `runningInWindows` is optional and backward-compatible. When present and `true`, it declares that the IDE server process is running on native Windows.
- Pi ignores malformed, stale, unmatched, and dead-process lock files. When Pi runs in WSL and sees `runningInWindows: true`, it does not delete the lock file merely because the Windows PID is not visible from Linux.

## WSL2 discovery and host resolution

The primary lock directory is always `~/.pi/pi-x-ide/lock`. When Pi runs inside WSL, it also scans Windows user lock directories such as `/mnt/c/Users/<user>/.pi/pi-x-ide/lock`, skipping Windows system profiles.

For connection hosts, Pi resolves in this order:

1. `PI_X_IDE_HOST_OVERRIDE`, either from the real environment or `~/.pi/pi-x-ide/config.json` `env`.
2. If Pi runs in WSL and the lock has `runningInWindows: true`, parse the WSL default gateway from `ip route show` and use it only if a short TCP probe to `<gateway>:<port>` succeeds.
3. The lock file `host` value.
4. `127.0.0.1` if `host` is empty.

Incoming editor paths are normalized to the Pi host before workspace matching, UI display, `@file#Lx-Ly` mention formatting, and prompt context formatting. Matching WSL UNC paths such as `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\user\project` become `/home/user/project` when Pi is running in the `Ubuntu` distro.

## Authentication

Pi connects to `ws://host:port` with the header:

```text
x-pi-x-ide-authorization: <authToken>
```

The IDE server rejects connections with missing or invalid tokens.

## Handshake

Pi sends:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "client": { "name": "pi-x-ide", "version": "0.1.0" },
    "cwd": "/home/user/project",
    "terminalSessionId": "optional-ide-terminal-session-id"
  }
}
```

`terminalSessionId` is optional. JetBrains terminals created by Pi x IDE use it to route manual attach notifications only to the currently selected Pi terminal.

IDE responds:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "server": {
      "name": "Pi x IDE VS Code",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "ide": "vscode"
    }
  }
}
```

## Notifications

### `selection_changed`

Sent whenever the active editor or selection changes.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "selection_changed",
  "params": {
    "source": "vscode",
    "filePath": "/home/user/project/src/main.ts",
    "workspaceFolder": "/home/user/project",
    "ranges": [
      {
        "text": "const x = 1;",
        "selection": {
          "start": { "line": 9, "character": 0 },
          "end": { "line": 9, "character": 12 }
        }
      }
    ],
    "receivedAt": 1780963200000
  }
}
```

`source` is one of `vscode`, `zed`, `nvim`, `jetbrains`, or `unknown`. `line` and `character` are zero-based, matching VS Code/LSP. Neovim converts byte columns to UTF-16 character offsets before sending snapshots. JetBrains derives `character` from document offsets and line-start offsets, which are UTF-16 code-unit counts.

JetBrains sends `selection_changed` both for non-empty selections and for an active local file with no selected text (`ranges: []`). It sends `selection_cleared` when there is no active local text editor.

### `at_mentioned`

Sent when the user invokes an IDE attach-selection command, such as VS Code's command, Neovim's `:PiXIdeAttach`, or the JetBrains **Pi x IDE: Attach Selection** action.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "at_mentioned",
  "params": {
    "source": "vscode",
    "filePath": "/home/user/project/src/main.ts",
    "workspaceFolder": "/home/user/project",
    "rangeText": "@src/main.ts#L10-L20",
    "ranges": [
      {
        "text": "selected text",
        "selection": {
          "start": { "line": 9, "character": 0 },
          "end": { "line": 19, "character": 3 }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Pi inserts `rangeText` into the TUI editor and caches the corresponding selection text for context injection. JetBrains sends selection and attach notifications in the MVP; it does not send diagnostic Quick Fix notifications.

### `diagnostic_fix_requested`

Sent by the VS Code-family extension when the user selects **Pi: Fix it** or **Pi: Send diagnostic** from Quick Fix on an error or warning diagnostic. This notification is additive under protocol version `1`; clients that do not understand it may ignore it.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "diagnostic_fix_requested",
  "params": {
    "action": "fix",
    "source": "vscode",
    "filePath": "/home/user/project/src/main.ts",
    "workspaceFolder": "/home/user/project",
    "documentVersion": 7,
    "triggerRange": {
      "start": { "line": 9, "character": 4 },
      "end": { "line": 9, "character": 10 }
    },
    "diagnostics": [
      {
        "severity": "error",
        "message": "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.",
        "source": "ts",
        "code": 2322,
        "range": {
          "start": { "line": 9, "character": 4 },
          "end": { "line": 9, "character": 10 }
        },
        "selectedText": "value",
        "contextLines": [
          { "line": 8, "text": "const value = getValue();", "isPrimary": false },
          { "line": 9, "text": "const count: number = value;", "isPrimary": true },
          { "line": 10, "text": "console.log(count);", "isPrimary": false }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "receivedAt": 1780963200000
  }
}
```

When `action` is `"fix"` or omitted, Pi formats the diagnostics into a prompt and sends it as a user message. If the agent is busy, Pi queues the diagnostic prompt as a follow-up. When `action` is `"send-diagnostic"`, Pi formats only the diagnostic context and pastes it into the TUI input box without starting an agent turn.

## TUI behavior

When connected, Pi displays IDE connection status in one place, selected by
`status_display` (project config overrides global; set via `/ide settings`):

- `widget` (default): above-editor widget via `ctx.ui.setWidget("pi-x-ide", ...)`.
- `statusline`: default footer status line via `ctx.ui.setStatus("pi-x-ide", ...)`.

Both placements show the compact connection/selection state (IDE icon, spinner or
status mark, file, range, and `pending` / `sent` attach state). Selected text
content is intentionally omitted.
